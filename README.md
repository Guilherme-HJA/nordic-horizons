<p style="text-align:center;"><i>A Northern Linux Rice </i></p>
<hr>

This is my current Linux rice that I made having the [Nord Color Palette](https://www.nordtheme.com) on Manjaro.  
_This will be my last rice before I dwelve into the Void. (I'm migrating to Void Linux, and I'll be making a new config)..._  
The customization was made with the **SwayWM** as the main environment, keep that in mind if you're not usind Wayland, specially on Kitty and some configs inside sway config file.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Present configs:
- WM: Sway;
- Bar: Waybar;
- Terminal: Kitty;
- Neovim | _Nothing special about this one, it's just a tweaked [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)_;
- Zathura;
- ~~Neofetch~~ (removed | repo archived);

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Some other things that will be necessary to run it smoothly are:
- HasklugNF Font (Hasklig)
- MesloLGS NF Font

<p>&nbsp;</p>

_Preview image will be added soon_
